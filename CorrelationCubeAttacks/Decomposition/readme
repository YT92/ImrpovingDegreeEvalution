  This program is writen in c. Its aim is to find cubes which are useful in the correlation cube attacks. 
  In main.cpp the function GetandTestX is called to filter potentail useful cubes. Then, we need to call the function GetandTestXVerifyV2 to verify whether a potential useful cube is really a useful cube. In the output file, there are "succedd!!!" and "Usatisified!!! Plaese try another cube" following a useful cube and  a useless cube respectively.
